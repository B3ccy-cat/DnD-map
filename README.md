HOW TO USE
Save python3 hex_map_editor_tkinter.py somewhere sensible
Make sure pillow is installed (pythin should prompt you to do this and guide you through it if you haven't)
Open command prompt and change directory to this folder
Type at the command prompt: python3 hex_map_editor_tkinter.py
When it asks you to locate the folder, navigate to where you saved "Realm Brew - Complete Bundle v0.2 KS" from Kick Starter
There's a "controls" button that will explain the commands

WHY TO USE
If you received all the tiles and overlays from Realm Brew, you'll be wanting to create maps!
This allows you to place, rotate and delete tiles
and place, rotate, scale, move and delete overlays.
Then save the map, or open one you've previously saved.

It's my first go at all of this so sorry if it's a bit basic!
